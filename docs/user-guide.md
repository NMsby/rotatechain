3. **Continue until all members have received**

**Payout Calculation:**
```
Payout = (Total Contributions × Group Size) + Earned Yield - Platform Fee
```

**Example:**
- 6 members × 1 ICP = 6 ICP base
- + 0.2 ICP earned yield
- - 0.05 ICP platform fee (0.25%)
- = 6.15 ICP total payout

### Your Turn to Receive

2. Choose payout preference:
   - **Withdraw:** Receive funds in your wallet
   - **Trade Mode:** Keep funds earning yield, get liquid tokens

2. Liquid tokens issued (representing your contributed value)
3. Continue contributing for remaining rounds

**Trade Mode Benefits:**
- Continue earning yield on your funds
- Receive liquid tokens immediately
- Trade tokens without affecting group
- Withdraw anytime after group completion

## Liquid Tokens Explained

### What Are Liquid Tokens?

**Key Features:**
- **1:1 Value:** Each rToken = 1 ICP contributed
- **Yield Bearing:** Earn additional returns

**Redeeming for ICP:**
1. Click "Redeem Tokens"
2. Enter amount to redeem
